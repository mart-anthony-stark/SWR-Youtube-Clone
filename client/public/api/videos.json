    "description": "We start out by creating a safe and legal environment for us to perform attacks in. Then, we cover the core concepts of SQL and injections. After that, we learn SQL injection techniques with the help of cheat sheets and references. At that point, we start to gather information about our target in order to find weaknesses and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nOnce we've gathered enough information, we go full-on offensive and perform SQL injections both by hand and with automated tools. These attacks will extract data such as tokens, emails, hidden products, and password hashes which we then proceed to crack.\n\nAfter successfully attacking and compromising our targets, we take a step back and discuss defensive controls at the network, application, and database layers. We also look at actual vulnerable code and show ways of fixing that vulnerable code to prevent injections.\n\nPlease note: Performing these attacks on environments you do not have explicit permissions for is illegal and will get you in trouble. That is not the purpose of this course. The purpose is to teach you how to secure your own applications.",
